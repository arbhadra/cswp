Go through the questions, google up which ever things you don't know how to answer and you're good to go!

Some specific instructions: 
a) For seg-1: Practise model mania- 2009 and how to do it efficiently.
b) For seg-2: Learn how FACE DELETE in DIRECT EDITING on solidworks works!
c) For seg-3: Watch what kindof questions are asked in the video and google the things you don't know. 



Important: THESE ARE BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WHEN I ATTENDED CSWP ON 2021 AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT TO BE FURTHER REVIEWED. FOLLOW THEM AT YOUR OWN RISK!! :')
